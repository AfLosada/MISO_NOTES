Common Types:
-   Executable files, such as ._exe_ or ._jar_ files
-   Library files, such as ._dll_s (or support _.jar_ files)
-   Source files, such as _.java_ or ._cpp_ files
-   Configuration files that are used by your software at runtime, commonly in formats such as ._xml_, ._properties_, or ._txt_
Because artifacts can contain various components, you can also use the `<<manifest>>` dependency to represent that this given artifact includes and manifests a component.
