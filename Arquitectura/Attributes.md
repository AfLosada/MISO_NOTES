Multiplicity is not only the amount, but it can also mean characteristics of the attribute.
	Entries attribute is ordered
	Trackbacks attribute is unique
### Inline vs Association Attributes

When to write the attributes as associations?
	When the class they reference is a complex part of the diagram that needs to be detailed.
When to write as inline?
	When the class is generic and detailing it would not give much value to the diagram. (Type File or String)
