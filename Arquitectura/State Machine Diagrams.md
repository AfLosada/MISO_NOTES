Modelling an [[Object]]'s [[state]]

These diagrams are useful when a given object of a class may behave differently if its [[attributes]] have a different [[state]].

These models consist of
1. Modelling different states of the attributes of an object
2. Modelling the events that change the states of the object.

These diagrams are part of the [[logical view]].

A [[state]] machine diagram consists of [[state]]s.

State Machine diagrams begin with an [[initial pseudostate]] and a [[final state]]. You can also have [[advanced pseudostates]].

In advanced state diagrams, you can also model [[internal behavior]] and [[internal transitions]].

You can also model [[Composite States]]
