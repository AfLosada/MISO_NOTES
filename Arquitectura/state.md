A state is the current value of the attributes of a class given certain circumstances. In order to arrive at a state, a [[transition]] must happen between some other state. 

States are either active or inactive.

States can have passive or active "states" for their attribtues
## Passive
A passive state for an attribute is a characteristic that does not mean an action. Ex: being on or off.
## Active
An active state for an attribute is an action that the state is doing. Ex: Brewing coffee, saving stuff in a db.
These states are written in UML as `do/ behavior`
