UML is a language that tries to abstract the way a system is modelled. This language, is a formal and complete language that is the industry standard for UML modelling. 

The language has a history and is currently (according to this book) in UML version 2.0.
This version includes a table like the following

| Diagram type | What can be modeled | Originally introduce in UML X.X | Go to |
|--|--|--|--|
|---|---|---|---|
|Use Case|Interactions between your system and users or other external systems. Also helpful in mapping requirements to your systems.|UML 1.x|[Chapter 2](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-uml-2-0/0596009828/ch02.html "Chapter 2. Modeling Requirements: Use Cases")|

UML models have different scopes.
- UML as a sketch
- UML as a blueprint
- UML as a programming language
These scopes differ in the level of complexity and reusability that they try to achieve. Using it as a programming language is not always the case, as it has been seen by various commercial companies that it slows development time and provides less value (than using it as a blueprint or sketch).

UML models can also be paired with [[Views]].
