## Module structures

- UML
- Systems partitioned into **implementation** units. This means that we want to communicate what is the actual code and software to be built.
- Help to reason about a system's modifiability

### Useful module structures

- [Decomposition Structures](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780136885979/ch01.xhtml#:-:text=Decomposition%20structure)
- [Uses structure](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-architecture-in/9780136885979/ch01.xhtml#:-:text=Uses%20structure). This one tries to communicate which elements require a functional an special version of the other to work as expected.
