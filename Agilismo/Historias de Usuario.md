I.N.V.E.S.T.
# Independent
Stories should be try to be independent, this means that we should aspire to create stories that do not rely too heavily on other stories. Stories that depend on each other are fine, but we need to create stories that are loosely coupled.  
# Negotiable
*stories are the placeholder of a conversation*
We want to negotiate the details, the implementation should not be set in stone. This some times cannot be fulfilled, but I think it is valuable to 
# Valuable
Stories should have value for the user or the customer.
Technical stories can exists, but the value should be clear to the **product owner.**
Most times, technical stories can be understood better as tasks, as they give value to a story but not by themselves.
# Estimatable
Stories must be able to be estimated. If they can't you have two choices:
- Break it down with the product owner
- Do some exploratory work to deepen the knowledge of the team so they are able to break it down.
# Sized Appropriately (small)
Stories should have an appropiate size for when they will be worked on. (epics, sprints)
# Testable
Stories must have tests they would fail or pass, this is normally understood as acceptance criteria.
Some acceptance criteria cannot be properly tested (99.999999% availability), but they should guide the design.
# Nonfunctional Requirements
They should be included in the Definitions of Done, as they drive the estimation and testability of other stories.
They are not always written as a story, but need to be taken into account.
